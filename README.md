Project Title

AI-Based Disease Prediction Using Blood Samples

Project Overview This project focuses on building an AI-based disease prediction system using patient blood test data. The goal is to accurately predict possible diseases while ensuring fairness, reliability, and real-world usability, even when some diseases appear less frequently in the dataset. To achieve this, a Balanced Random Forest model is used instead of traditional machine-learning approaches. This model prevents bias toward common diseases and improves predictions for rare and critical conditions. The system is designed with: Leakage-safe preprocessing Overfitting control Evaluation on completely unseen test data In addition to the AI model, the project includes a backend and frontend, allowing users to input blood test values and receive predictions in real time.
